*Above is a video of a reinforcement learning model that was trained with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for 1M iterations. It averages around a score of 20.*

This project was made in July 2022. In this project, I programmed the Snake Game with **pygame**. The goal is to obtain as many apples/foods/points as possible by controlling the snake with the arrow keys on your keyboard. The snake dies when it either runs into a wall or runs into itself. After programming the game itself, I programmed a custom environment to train a snake agent to play the game successfully through policy gradient reinforcement learning. Packages used include Stable Baselines3, Gym, NumPy, and others.
